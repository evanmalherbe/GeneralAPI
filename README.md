# General API
This is a general API that I use for some of my personal coding projects. It's built using **.NET 8 with an MVC** (Mode-View-Controller) architecture.<br/>

## Description
This API is built with **.NET 8 MVC** and is live on [Railway](https://railway.com). It connects to a managed **Postgres SQL** database hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com). 

## Usage
You could run this API on your local machine from the code on my Github repository, but it won't do you much good without the connection string to connect to my Postgres database. As an alternative that will still allow you to review the functionality of the API, you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to hit some of the endpoints on the live API that is at [https://generalapi-production-b0ac.up.railway.app](https://generalapi-production-b0ac.up.railway.app). <br/><br/> For example, the following endpoints can be accessed with a **GET** request:
- `https://generalapi-production-b0ac.up.railway.app/api/home/framework` - Tech Frameworks I've used before
- `https://generalapi-production-b0ac.up.railway.app/api/home/education` - My educational history data
- `https://generalapi-production-b0ac.up.railway.app/api/home/projects` - Coding projects I've recently worked on
